# Fix Trading System Order Execution and Logging

## Problem/Goal
Critical trading system failures occurring with trim and exit orders since switching to market-based order pricing. The primary error is `'EnhancedRobinhoodTrader' object has no attribute 'place_option_sell_order_with_retry'`, causing all sell orders to fail. Additionally, the system needs comprehensive logging improvements and performance tracking instrumentation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Research and analyze why the previous two fix attempts failed
- [ ] Fix missing `place_option_sell_order_with_retry` method in EnhancedRobinhoodTrader
- [ ] Remove redundant/outdated code from market-based pricing migration
- [ ] Implement daily log rotation with automatic cleanup
- [ ] Implement 5-phase latency instrumentation (T0-T5 checkpoints)
- [ ] Create unified CSV trade tracking system
- [ ] Verify trim orders execute successfully 
- [ ] Verify exit orders execute successfully
- [ ] All error handling preserves trade state and provides actionable feedback

## Phase 1: Failure Analysis & Core Fix
- [ ] **Research**: Investigate previous two failed fix attempts via git history
- [ ] **Root Cause**: Identify why `place_option_sell_order_with_retry` is missing
- [ ] **Fix**: Restore/implement the missing method properly

## Phase 2: Daily Log Rotation (Priority)
- [ ] **File Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_debug.log`, `YYYY-MM-DD_errors.log`
- [ ] **Retention**: 30 days with automatic cleanup
- [ ] **Integration**: Update all logging calls across the system

## Phase 3: 5-Phase Latency Instrumentation
- [ ] **Timing Checkpoints**: T0: Alert received → T1: Parsed → T2: Validated → T3: Executed → T4: Targets set → T5: Confirmed
- [ ] **Precision**: Millisecond precision, minimal overhead
- [ ] **Coverage**: Instrument entry points, decision points, execution points

## Phase 4: Unified CSV Trade Tracking
- [ ] **CSV Structure**: date,time,channel,alert_type,ticker,strike,expiration,trade_id,parent_trade_id,alerted_price,executed_price,contracts,sell_alert_price,sell_executed_price,pnl_percent,is_reactive,target_level,parse_latency_ms,validate_latency_ms,execute_latency_ms,setup_latency_ms,confirm_latency_ms,total_processing_time_ms,status,notes

## User Notes
**Critical Error Examples:**
1. **PSKY Trim Failure** (6:37 AM): `Trim execution error: 'EnhancedRobinhoodTrader' object has no attribute 'place_option_sell_order_with_retry'`
2. **Exit Order Failure** (9:06 AM): `Exit execution error: 'EnhancedRobinhoodTrader' object has no attribute 'place_option_sell_order_with_retry'`

**Root Cause**: Error started when switching to market-based order pricing, suggesting method removal/renaming during refactoring.

**Processing Flow**: Fast parsing working (0.5ms), OpenAI fallback working (2689ms latency), but execution failing at order placement.

**Previous Fix Analysis Needed**: Two previous attempts failed - need to understand what was tried and why it didn't work to avoid repeating mistakes.
